TALIWARE’S AND ITS LICENSORS’</p>
<p>ENTIRE AND AGGREGATE LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT<br>(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, SHALL NOT EXCEED<br>$100, EVEN IF TALIWARE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES<br>AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Arbitration Agreement in Section 30 shall be<br>governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.

<p><br>25. This Agreement may not be modified, supplemented, qualified, or interpreted by any trade usage or<br>prior course of dealing not made a part of the Agreement by its express terms.</p>
<p><br>26. Each provision of this Agreement is a separately enforceable provision. If any provision of this<br>Agreement is determined to be or becomes unenforceable or illegal, such provision shall be reformed<br>to the minimum extent necessary in order for this Agreement to remain in effect in accordance with its<br>terms as modified by such reformation. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this<br>Agreement shall not affect the validity of this Agreement as a whole and any such provision should be<br>enforced by authorities, and reconstructed if need be, to apply to the maximum extent allowable under<br>applicable law.</p>
<p><br>27. The failure by either party to enforce at any time any of the provisions of this Agreement, to exercise<br>any election or option provided herein, or to require at any time the performance of the other of any of<br>the provisions herein will not in any way be construed as a waiver of such provisions. No failure or<br>delay in enforcing any right or exercising any remedy will be deemed a waiver of any right or remedy.</p>
<p><br>28. Reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs will be awarded to the prevailing party in the event of litigation<br>involving the enforcement or interpretation of this Agreement.</p>
<p><br>29. The section headings used herein are for convenience only and shall not be given any legal import.</p>
<p><br>30. Any dispute, controversy or claim arising under, out of or relating to this Agreement and any<br>subsequent amendments of this Agreement, including, without limitation, its formation, validity,<br>binding effect, interpretation, performance, breach or termination, as well as non-contractual claims,<br>shall be submitted to arbitration before the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance<br>with the AAA [Consumer or Commercial] Arbitration Rules. &nbsp;The place of arbitration shall be San<br>Diego, California. The language to be used in the arbitral proceedings shall be English. &nbsp;The parties<br>may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for a temporary restraining order, preliminary<br>injunction, or other interim or conservatory relief as necessary, without breach of this Section and<br>without abridgment of the powers of the arbitrator. &nbsp;The arbitrator may award any form of individual or<br>equitable relief, including injunctive relief. Any award will be final and conclusive to the parties and<br>may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. &nbsp;You agree to the entry of injunctive relief to<br>stop any lawsuit or to remove you as a participant in such a suit. By using the Site in any manner, you</p>
<p>agree to this arbitration agreement. In doing so, YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT<br>to assert or defend any claims between you and Taliware. YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO<br>PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING. This provision<br>preventing you from bringing, joining or participating in class action lawsuits is an independent<br>covenant. You may opt-out of this Section by providing written notice of your decision within thirty<br>(30) days of the date that you first use the Site<br>All claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement, to the Services, or to your relationship with<br>Taliware that, for whatever reason, are not submitted to arbitration will be litigated exclusively in the<br>federal or state courts of San Diego County, San Diego, California, U.S.A. You and Taliware consent<br>to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts in the State of California and waive any claim<br>that such courts constitute an inconvenient forum.</p>
<p><br>31. This Agreement shall constitute the entire agreement between the parties regarding the subject matter<br>hereof and supersede all proposals and prior discussions and writings between the parties with respect<br>thereto.</p>
